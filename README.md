## ðŸ§¨ Exploitation Steps: Bypassing CAPTCHA by Tampering the Request
#### âœ… 1. Submit CAPTCHA Form Once

- Enter values for new_password, confirm_password, and keep CAPTCHA blank.
- Submit the form
- Capture the request using Developer Tools.

### âœ… 2. Select the form and find the value field
Search for the 'form' in DevTools and in the form select 'step=1&password_new=123&password_conf=123&Change=Change'

#### âœ… 3. Intercept and Modify the Request

- Change the request to directly submit `step=2` like this:

Then submit the form again by entering new_password, confirm_password 
This bypasses CAPTCHA verification entirely.

#### âœ… 4. Observe the Response

- You should see the message:

#### âœ… CAPTCHA successfully bypassed using a direct POST to Step 2.
- The application trusts the step=2 parameter to indicate that CAPTCHA verification has already been completed. By directly submitting a POST request with step=2 and matching passwords, an attacker can bypass CAPTCHA entirely, exposing a critical flaw in the authentication flow that relies on client-side input for server-side validation.
